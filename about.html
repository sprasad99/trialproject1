<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Sumana, currently an Assistant Manager within the Smart Nation Strategy Office at the Ministry of Communications and Information. This is a trial portfolio website as part of a month-long web-development course.</p>

<p>My interests include exploring the intersections between policy, digital technologies and social well-being. As part of my work, I also utilize foresight tools to sense-make the development of emerging digital technologies and their impact on Singapore's long-term digital strategy.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction books on the environment and politics, baking, going for long walks, watching k-dramas on Netflix and learning languages.</p>
